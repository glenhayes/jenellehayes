            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
              Born in <strong>Canada</strong>, I craft out of my homeland with passion and care. Spending time outdoors - exploring nature, attending the orchestra, and visiting an art gallery or a museum are things I enjoy doing. I care about the environment and am trying to limit my impact on it. My education has me formally trained in new media production and design, as well as print communications.
